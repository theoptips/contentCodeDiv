#Meta Info for Web Development Languages, Tools and Framework

Project Kalamari is a Github based, open source project. Provides meta information about various web, mobile and traditional programming languages to help beginners get started

With all the cute logos and wonderful names, it's getting hard for beginners to successfully navigate the ocean of programming tools. We are lending a helping hand here, essentially building a profile page for each modern language / tool / framework.
